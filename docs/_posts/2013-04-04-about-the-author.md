[comment]: <> (Hi there! I'm Paul. Iâ€™m a physics major turned programmer. Ever since I first learned how to program while taking a scientific computing for physics course, I have pursued programming as a passion, and as a career. Check out [my personal website]&#40;https://www.lenpaul.com/&#41; for more information on my other projects &#40;including more Jekyll themes!&#41;, as well as some of my writing.)
